### Introduction

Our project is called map attraction. Basically it will tell user what attractions are around. For example, one walkes into a new location, he wants to find
a restrurant, then he can use this app to rapidly locate the restaurant around. Also, if he just wants to explore the area, he can see all the attractions around. 

### Functional Requirements
1.	Display a map view with all attractions and facilities(restaurants, entertainments, hotels, tourist attractions etc) within the screen range around you as pin points
2.	Can click on one pin point and show detailed information about that attraction, including name, distance to your current location, description, category and rating
3.	Can use filters to filter which places to display. Filters include category, distance, and rating.
4.	Can manually input places of interest into the system for all other users to see. Necessary information includes name, description and location
5.	Can zoom in and zoom out or move around in the map and places within the screen range will display

### Non-functional requirements
1.	Map will update to always display places around the user as userâ€™s location change in real time
2.	UI design should be aesthetically professional and easy to interact with for users.

### API

To get data for existing attractions and facilities, we will use *Places API*. See [Places API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/opentripmap/api/places1/endpoints) for details and usage.
